# Blob Person

**Blob Person** is a puzzle platformer project I began developing in 2020.  
While I’ve decided to discontinue active development, I’m making the project files that I have the rights to available for download.  

My hope is that others may:  
- Learn from the project structure and code  
- Find the assets useful for their own work  
- Or perhaps even continue and complete the game  

The game is approximately **80% complete** in its current state.  
Please note that some features are broken due to the removal of third-party assets that cannot be redistributed (e.g., Ultra Dynamic Sky).  

All included files are free to use under the licenses specified in this repository.
