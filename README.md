# Blob Person

**Blob Person** is a puzzle platformer project I began developing in 2020.  
While I’ve decided to discontinue active development, I’m making the project files that I have the rights to available for download.  

My hope is that others may:  
- Learn from the project structure and code  
- Find the assets useful for their own work  
- Or perhaps even continue and complete the game  

The game is approximately **80% complete** in its current state.  
Please note that some features are broken due to the removal of third-party assets that cannot be redistributed (e.g., Ultra Dynamic Sky).  

All included files are free to use under the licenses specified in this repository. 

⚠️ Note: This repository only contains the licenses for the project. All Unreal Engine assets are included in the Google Drive download.
WinRar or similar program will be required to extract files from the .rar archive
